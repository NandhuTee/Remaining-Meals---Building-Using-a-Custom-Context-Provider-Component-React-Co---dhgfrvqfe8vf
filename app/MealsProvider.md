**use client:**

This is a pragma directive used in Next.js to mark a file as a client-side component. It indicates that the code within this file should only be executed on the client-side, not on the server-side.
In this context, it ensures that the MealsProvider component and its related functionality are only executed in the client environment.

**import React, { useState, createContext } from "react";**

This line imports necessary functions and modules from the React library.
useState is a React hook used for managing state within functional components.
createContext is a function from React used to create a context object for sharing data across components in a component tree.

**const todaysMeals = [ ... ];**

This defines an array todaysMeals containing objects representing meals for the current day.
Each meal object has properties like id, name, and ticked. The ticked property is initially set to false for each meal.

**export const MealContext = createContext();**

This line creates a context object named MealContext using the createContext function.
The context object will be used to share state and functions related to meals with child components.

**const MealsProvider = ({ children }) => { ... };**

This defines a functional component named MealsProvider.
It receives children as a prop, which represents the child components wrapped by the MealsProvider.

**const [meals, setMeals] = useState(todaysMeals);**

This line uses the useState hook to initialize a state variable meals with the initial value of todaysMeals.
setMeals is a function used to update the meals state.

**const tickMeal = (id) => { ... };**

This defines a function tickMeal that toggles the ticked property of a meal object with the specified id.
It updates the meals state using setMeals by mapping over the array of meals and toggling the ticked property of the matching meal.

**<MealContext.Provider value={{ meals, tickMeal }}> ... </MealContext.Provider>;**

This JSX code wraps the children components with the MealContext.Provider.
It provides the meals state and tickMeal function as values to the context, making them accessible to child components within the context tree.

**export default MealsProvider;**

This line exports the MealsProvider component as the default export, allowing other modules to import and use it.
